    "* Can make it easier to explore the history of changes\n",
    "* Enables you to go back to an earlier state to find the source of a bug\n",
    "* Allows you to try things out without worrying about breaking the things that work\n",
    "* Can make it easier to incorporate changes from collaborators, even if you’re all making simultaneous changes to the same set of files.\n",

    "There are a number of different version control systems, but I’d recommend starting with git, because it’s widely used, and because of GitHub, which simplifies collaboration and exploration.\n",

    "Version control is a tough sell. It requires a big initial investment in time and effort, initial experiences are often rocky, and the advantages are mostly long-term. And it may seem like a big day-to-day hassle, though trust me that, after a month or so, it will become a natural part of your daily workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by putting a single project under version control. Ideally convince a collaborator to work on it with you. (Version control has huge short-term advantages in collaborative projects, such as in merging simultaneous changes, or just keeping in sync.)\n",
