    "The most basic aspect of reproducible research is that everything you do (convert data files, clean data, analyze data) should be accomplished via code. Pointing and clicking, and copy-paste, are not reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ideally, __get the data in the most-raw form possible__. And get any/all data and meta data possible. And keep track of the provenance of all data files. (You don’t want to be asking, “Where did these microarray annotations come from?”)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you need to __download external data__, such as from the web, it’s best to do so via a script, for example with wget or curl. (Consider the R package httr.) If that’s not feasible, at least document the source of the data (and perhaps the date/time it was acquired).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you need to __convert a data file__ from one form to another, use a script. For example, to convert an Excel file to a CSV file, I use xls2csv.py or xlsx2csv.py. Rather than opening the file in excel and saving each sheet by hand, do this with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Don’t hand-edit data files__. If you need to delete some initial rows, or if you want to change some column names, don’t open up the file and edit it by hand. Write a script that does so. I like to write ruby scripts for this sort of thing; you might use python or perl, or even R.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All aspects of __data cleaning should be in scripts__. If you decide that you need to omit a couple of subjects, don’t go into the data file and delete those rows, but rather write a script that will delete those subjects and create a separate, revised data file. If you find some errors in the data, don’t go into the file and change it by hand, but rather make those changes via a script (or have the changes made to the primary database, in a documented and versioned way).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each aspect of the __analysis should be in scripts__. Make these straight-forward to run. It shouldn’t be “run this set of lines to do this and those lines to do that,” or even worse, “change this variable and then re-run it to do that.” (I’ve written lots of scripts like that in the past; they’re neither pretty nor reproducible.) Ideally, break things up into functions, to make the code easier to follow and to avoid repeated code. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Save your seeds for random number generation__. While in many cases it is useful to re-run a simulation with independent replicates, if you want your simulations to be fully reproducible, use a defined seed and save it in your script. In R, I’ll typically use runif(1, 0, 10^8) in an interactive session, and then copy that number into a line at the top of my script, like set.seed(91820205). If I’m running multiple batches of simulations in parallel, I’ll typically use something like set.seed(91820205 + i) for batch i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, it may seem like a hassle to do many of these things via code rather than by hand. But if the primary data should change (and it often does), repeating all of that by-hand extraction and editing is a huge hassle, while re-running the scripts should be super easy (particularly if automated, more on that later).\n",
