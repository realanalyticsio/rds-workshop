    "Pulling out the major parts of your scripts as separate functions has the advantage that you can more easily reuse that code.\n",

    "\n",
    "When possible, package up those useful functions as a stand-alone thing. This will make it easier for you (and others) to reuse them. It’s also a good opportunity to document those functions.\n",

    "Writing R packages is really not so hard as one might think. See my R package primer, Hadley Wickham’s R packages book, or Hilary Parker’s tutorial on R packages. If you’ve written a personal R package, you might include your miscellaneous functions there, or write a separate small package specific to your project.\n",
